# Task #

Create a simple slot game with a 3x3 grid and 4 different symbols. When the spin button is
pressed the reels start to spin, then stop - revealing any of the 4 random symbols on each
position. If two or more of the same symbol is displayed on the same row you get a win: each
symbol is worth $1. For example, if the symbols would land like the image below you would win
a total of $9. Note that it’s only counted as a win from left to right. Getting two or more symbols
from right to left doesn’t count as a win. Winnings should have clear visual feedback. The game
should also include a simple UI with elements showing your bet, win and balance. A spin costs
$2 and is subtracted from your balance. Winning should add to your balance.
